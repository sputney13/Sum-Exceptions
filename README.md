# Sum-Exceptions

Assignment: Write a program that sums up all of the numbers in a file on your machine. The text file should contain one number per line in the file. Some lines of the file may not contain numbers (which would lead to a ValueError), you should be able to handle this and simply skip over those lines in your sum. Sometimes the file may not exist (FileNotFoundError), you should also handle this properly.
